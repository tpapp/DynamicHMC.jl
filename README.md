## Overview

This package implements a modern version of the “No-U-turn sampler” in the Julia language, mostly as described in [Betancourt (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434), with some tweaks.

In contrast to frameworks which utilize a directed acyclic graph to build a posterior for a Bayesian model from small components, this package requires that you code a *log-density function* of the posterior in Julia. Derivatives can be provided manually, or using [automatic differentiation](http://www.juliadiff.org/).

Consequently, this package requires that the user is comfortable with the basics of the theory of Bayesian inference, to the extent of coding a (log) posterior density in Julia. This approach allows the use of standard tools like [profiling](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/profile/) and [benchmarking](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) to optimize its [performance](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/).

The building blocks of the algorithm are implemented using a *functional* (non-modifying) approach whenever possible, allowing extensive unit testing of components, while at the same time also intended to serve as a transparent, pedagogical introduction to the low-level mechanics of current Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, and as a platform for research into MCMC methods.

Please start with the [documentation](https://tpapp.github.io/DynamicHMC.jl/latest).

## Examples

- Some basic examples are available in [DynamicHMCExamples.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/DynamicHMCExamples.jl).

- [DynamicHMCModels.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/DynamicHMCModels.jl) contains worked examples from the [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book.

## Support and participation

For general questions, open an issue or ask on [the Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/). I am happy to help with models.

Users who rely on this package and want to participate in discussions are recommended to subscribe to the Github notifications (“watching” the package). Also, I will do my best to accommodate feature requests, just open issues.
